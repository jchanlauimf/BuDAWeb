From the  Technical Note on systemic risk analysis and stress testing: 

<blockquote>
<font color="lightblue">
PDs for certain exposure classes such as foreign sovereigns and institutions
are calculated for so called “low default portfolios,” and thus macroeconomic variables are
typically not very useful to model such defaults. Historical PDs data for the institutions exposure
class show little correlation with macroeconomic developments in Japan or key foreign regions
included in the macro forecast scenarios (Euro zone, United Kingdom, U.S., Emerging Asia). To
overcome this problem, <font color="orange">an alternative approach was used: PDs for institution asset class were
forecasted using the BuDA methodology.</font> This model projects one-year
PDs for up to five years using the same macroeconomic scenarios. In the baseline scenario, it was
assumed that PDs would remain constant. BuDA PDs behave very similarly to EDFs. The estimation
uses equity prices and risk free rates (3-month Japan Treasury bill rates) as regressors. Both
scenarios reveal similar outcomes: in the moderate adverse scenario, the increase in PDs is driven by
a decline in equity prices, negative risk free rates (this reduces banks profitability), and in the severe
adverse one by a decline in equity prices, a decline in GDP and a flattening of th
