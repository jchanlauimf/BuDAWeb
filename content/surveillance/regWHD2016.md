# Economic and financial context

From chapter 3: 

<blockquote>
<font color="lightblue">
Companies thrive in a healthy economy, and thriving companies are good business for banks. The converse is,
of course, also true. In this box, we assess the <font color="orange">impact of changes in macroeconomic conditions on nonfinancial
corporate solvency risk</font>, and its implications for the banking sector in LA5 countriesâ€”Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. In particular, we estimate the potential effect on bank provisions and capital
from an increase in corporate solvency risk. Banks in LA5 countries have a sizable exposure to corporate
lending, ranging from 8 percent of GDP in Mexico to 35 percent of GDP in Chile.

</blockquote>

The companion working paper, <em>Bottom-Up Default Analysis of Corporate Solvency Risk: An Application to Latin America</em>,
 presents the analysis in more detail.
