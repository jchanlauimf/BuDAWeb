# Economic and financial context

From the Country Report document, Annex II on macrofinancial linkages:


<blockquote>
<font color="lightskyblue">
Risks are tilted to the downside. On
the downside, an unexpected slowdown in China or setbacks from pending adjustments in Brazil
could dampen exports and investment, and tighten financing conditions as investor risk aversion
increases. Sustained uncertainty about U.S. domestic policies, a shift towards protectionism, and
faster than expected tightening of monetary policy could dampen external demand while raising
inflation as the peso depreciates. Domestically, the recovery in confidence could be further delayed
by a drawn-out resolution of legal uncertainty embedded in the new labor bill.
</font>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color="lightskyblue">
The impact of downside risks materializing could be amplified through macro-financial
linkages. Although balance sheets in key sectors appear to be healthy (Annex II.A), historically high
household debt (60 percent of GDP), high leverage among non-financial corporates, and strong
inter-sectoral balance-sheet linkages are sources of vulnerability (network chart). Among large
corporates, foreign currency debt is substantial (55 percent in 2016Q1), although long maturities,
a substantial share of FDI related debt, and financial and natural hedges are containing risks
from currency mismatches.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color="lightskyblue">
Severe stress tests of corporate balance sheets, which substantially raise
default probabilities of externally exposed firms, show that credit losses would be substantial. Even
so, the banking sector would manage to absorb a rise in credit costs thanks to sufficient capital
buffers.
