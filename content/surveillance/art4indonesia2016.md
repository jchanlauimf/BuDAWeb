# Economic and financial context

From the Selected Issues document, chapter 2: 

<blockquote>
<font color="lightblue">
While overall corporate sector risks in Indonesia appear manageable, some corporates are facing
higher risks including exchange rate, refinancing, or default, with possible spillovers to the banking
system. With a slowing economy and a weakened rupiah, corporate balance sheets are expected to
provide smaller buffers against negative macroeconomic shocks going forward. This paper assesses
corporate sector vulnerabilities. It first describes the current situation in the corporate sector, and then
<font color="orange">projects corporate default probabilities under different macroeconomic scenarios.</font> Results from the
scenario analyses suggest that if economic growth slows sharply and recovers only slowly, the default
probabilities of domestic firms could rise to levels comparable to those during the Global Financial
Crisis. While this is a low-probability scenario, policy makers should continue to closely monitor
vulnerabilities and step up effort to strengthen contingency plans.
